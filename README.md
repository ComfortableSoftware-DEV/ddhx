# ddhx - EDIT-like hex file viewer

ddhx is meant as a replacement for my [0xdd](https://github.com/dd86k/0xdd) tool.

This is work in progress, so come back again later!

## FAQ

### Why port it to D?
C# is a great language. However, it requires .NET or the Mono runtime on macOS and Linux systems, which requires extra effort to install for a simple tool.

As a native tool, it'll be ready out of the box.
